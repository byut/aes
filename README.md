# Advanced Encryption Standard

An implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Assembly language, utilizing the Intel
Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI).

## Overview

An AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instruction set comprises specialized instructions designed
for efficient AES encryption and decryption operations. Typically integrated into modern processors,
these instructions significantly enhance AES performance compared to software implementations.

Currently, this repository offers AES implementation for 128 and 256-bit operations. You should be
able to locate additional examples on the internet that delve into more comprehensive aspects of
AES.
